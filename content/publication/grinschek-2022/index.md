abstract: "A new course for the Master's programme was designed to attract chemical and bioengineers as well as process engineers to the field of additive manufacturing and to provide them with an effective approach and important basics to promote a wider use of additive manufacturing technologies for the production of components for applications in chemical process engineering. The article describes the structure of the course consisting of lecture and practical course and summarises the experiences made in the first two years. The students show great interest in additive manufacturing and are also able to develop creative solutions and functional components with assistance. However, they generally have deficits in the use of CAD programmes, which should be remedied in the future through a specific lecture. "
