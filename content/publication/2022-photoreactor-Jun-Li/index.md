abstract: "Photocatalysis for organic synthesis has experienced rapid progress over the last decades, which serves as an alternative to conventional synthetic routines. However, the photochemical reactor setup of many published works remains ambiguous due to missing standardized protocols. Therefore, a general design of batch photoreactor is required to circumvent the problem of difficult reproducibility and experimental inconsistencies. In this report which we have termed a technical note, a novel batch photoreactor with temperature feedback control and modulated light intensity was assembled from several low-cost, commercially available components, which will assist other researchers to reproduce this standardized reactor for use in their own research."
