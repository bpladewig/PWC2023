This research project is a collaboration with [Professor Manoj Neergat](https://www.ese.iitb.ac.in/faculty/manoj-neergat) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB). We develop a long-term research activity in the area of ammonia and hydrogen, specifically looking at electrochemical reactions, catalysts and systems. This is driven by the very active interest in global transport of green hydrogen from regions with abundant solar resources (e.g. Australia, Africa, Brazil), to consumers in Europe for example. The complexities and challenges of long-distance transport of compressed or liquified hydrogen mean that it is quite attractive to convert green hydrogen into a carrier molecule like ammonia, which is then converted back to hydrogen for injection into pipelines or directly at the consumer site.

Professor Neergat will be appointed as a visiting Professor at the University of Luxembourg and make three extended research sabbaticals (in 2023, 2024 and 2025) - in total 12 months, participating in the research and teaching activities in the Department of Engineering and especially on focussed research activities around electrochemical conversion of ammonia to hydrogen.

This project is suported by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg), INTER-MOBILITY Project Number 17548946.
